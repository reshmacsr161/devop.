JENKINS
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows continuous integration. Jenkins offers a straightforward way to set up a continuous integration or continuous delivery environment for almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using pipelines, as well as automating other routine development tasks.
The following are the main or most popular Jenkins use cases:
●	Continuous Integration: With Jenkins pipelines, we can achieve CI for both applications and infrastructure as code.
●	Continuous Delivery: You can set up well-defined and automated application delivery workflows with Jenkins pipelines.

Jenkins achieves CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) with the help of plugins. Plugins are used to allow the integration of various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you must install the plugins for that tool.
